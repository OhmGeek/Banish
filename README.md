This is a SysAdmin tool for managing computers, allowing admins to shutdown, or logout computers in a given room.

It was written using Visual Studio 2010/2013, and only runs on Windows in the current form. It's a pretty basic program, but proved useful during my computer room management days. One can custom rooms, one per file, by entering the computer host name (or the IP address). 

Computers highlighted in green text are powered on and those in black are turned off.

The initial project was written before I used GitHub, from June 2014 - May 2015. It was co-written by Tom Chambers (http://tom-chambers.co.uk).
